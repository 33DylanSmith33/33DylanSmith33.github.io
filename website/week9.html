    <h1>Week 9 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>Last week, I finally conceptualized what is happening during back propagation. I found a video on youtube 
        (by 3Blue1Brown or something like that) that explained the concept of NN's using visuals that really 
        helped. One of the big hold ups that I had with this understanding was that when I was building my NN, I 
        was feeding the data in aggregate rather than looking at what happens with a single input observation. 
        Looking at it from a single observation strips away a lot of the complexity because now you cut away an 
        extra step in understanding of how the backpropagation process is averaged across the input observations. 
        When you look at the aggregate that way, you can't conceptually isolate things like "for this single 
        observation with a single classification, the activations look like this. And when the activations look 
        like this, we can compare that to what we want the output activations to look like to understand why the 
        back propagation is changing weights the way that it is." Looking at it from that perpective helped me understand 
        what is actually happening during back prop. The other thing I did last week was start a file structure and file 
        where I started to build out the package that I will be building for this.</p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p>Next week, now that I think I have the understanding at a point where training is less of a black box, I want to
         start building out the classes and subclasses for the project. Subclasses will include things like layer, 
         activation function, batch processing, etc. Implementing the architecture (for a simple MLP) and functioning up 
         to forward propagation should be realtively easy and straight forward, so I think I can get up to that point in 
         this next week. After that will be back propagation and fitting everything together which I think will take a bit longer.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>My biggest obstacle throughout this whole process has just been understanding. I haven't been able to sit down for 5 
        hours straight up until now to really understand everything conceptually, and as I mentioned above, I didn't have the 
        right framework of looking at it one observation at a time. Now that I feel comfortable with that, I think the rest
         of the steps should be easier to put together because it will be more of a coding issue than a conceptual issue.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>To improve what I've been doing, I'm going to build and test my implementation for a single observation each training 
        step (bad in practice but easier for testing and seeing how everything is working.) Something that would help would 
        be to create a visual so I can see what is happening as it happens but I don't know if that is something worth doing 
        for how much time it could possible take.</p>
