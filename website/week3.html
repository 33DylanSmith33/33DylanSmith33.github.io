    <h1>Week 3 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>This week I finished my project proposal which helped me solidify a plan and schedule for the rest of the semester. With the plan I made, the first step is to review and study the fundamentals of neural nets (i.e. math, structure, etc.) so I have been going through the video my project is based on and other educational materials to wrap my head around the architecture and the different parts that go into making a neural net.</p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p>My next steps are to finish reviewing the material I need and then to actually start implementing a neural net by following along with the video. I also have to spend some time figuring out how to configure my github website because I don't really understand how that works or how to add updates and the proposal to it.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>The only impediments really are time constraints from work and other classes. I plan to spend a couple hours this weekend finishing up the review and then for the rest of the semester following the schedule I have laid out for the project.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>I think the main thing that I can do to improve how I'm doing is just to get started earlier in the week. Alotting a couple hours to this class is less than most of my other ones so I want to get that time in earlier in the week because this is something I'm really interested in so I don't want to feel pressured working on it.</p>
