    <h1>Week 4 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>Studied the different terms related to NN's so that I could understand what was happening as I went through the building process. Also researched the process of building a NN as far as what steps depend on previous steps and what order those have to be built in. I have the video to follow along with, but this gave me a deeper understanding of why he does each thing he does as well as an idea of how to set this up in a modular way.</p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p>This week I plan to start building the neural network. I will follow the video but I want to implement this using classes so that it is more modular. This will allow me to improve my ability to use classes to implement OOP. I'm thinking initially that I'll have a class for layer type and optimization function so that I'll be able to build a NN modularly.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>Not too much except for time. I'm participating in a Hackathon this weekend so I won't be able to put any time towards this and I have other classes and job things so I'll have to just carve out some time for this.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>Something that I did that worked really well was just blocking out a chunk of time to put towards this. I think if I do this in hour blocks I won't be able to follow what I'm doing as easily so just sitting down for a few hours and working on this will be my process. Something I did that didn't work really well is that I left this until after my other classes so I felt some pressure in having to put time towards it. Next week I'd like to set my time for this project earlier in the week so I can work on it without any extra pressure.  </p>
