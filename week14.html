    <h1>Week 14 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>This week I worked on my Network class and making it implement all of the other classes. I have 
        the forward and backward propagation functions working and have them tested in a separate ipynb. 
        I also included a section to upload the data within the class so that all you pass when you 
        instantiate a Network instance is the paths to your training and testing data. This is so that in
         the future I will be able to implement different methods of training.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p> Next week I need to finish the Network class so that the train and predict functions work and 
        then maybe add some functionality for testing the network.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>Impediments now are just time. I was overly ambitious in what I hoped to accomplish with this 
        project and haven't gotten as far as I thought I would. I should be able to finish the modular 
        building of it but things like making it work for all kinds of data are probably out of the 
        scope although I do have ideas of how to do that I think.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>I think a way that would make this work better would be to put in more than 3 hours a week 
        like only doing this for a week. I think I would spend a lot less time relearning what I did 
        previously and would be much more efficient in my time.
