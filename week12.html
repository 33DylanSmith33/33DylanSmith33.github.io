    <h1>Week 12 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>This last week I got really far in my implementation of a neural net. I have implementations of Layers,
         Activations, and Optimizer as well as Network that takes all three of those previous ones and uses them 
         to build a full NN. I learned about using abstract classes and the abc package as well as how to make 
         each of those different parts of the NN simple and modular so that they're easier to use than my previous 
         attempts and fit together better. The fitting them together is especially important in the Network class 
         because it handles all of the logic of how the pieces connect.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p> This next week I want to finish the Network implementation so that I can actually train a model and test 
        accuracies and training times of different architectures. Once I can get my implementation working, I can 
        start adding more units like other layer types or activation function or optimizers.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>There aren't really any impediments in my way except for the normal trying to get this all working. Also my
         implementation is currently only really useful for the digit classification problem I based this on so at 
         some point I'll have to figure out how to make this able to do other classification problems.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>I think the process went pretty good this week and I made a lot of progress. The only thing I can think of 
        to make it work better is to keep learning more about the fundamentals of NN's. I didn't keep up with the 
        Karpathy videos very well and just the bit i have watched helped a lot this week so keeping that up should 
        make everything clearer as I go forward
