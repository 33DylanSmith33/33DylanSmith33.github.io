    <h1>Week 6 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>This week I worked more on getting my NN up and running. I ran into some conceptual issues trying to figure out how back propagation worked so I spend a lot of time trying to wrap my head around that. I have the code written up to 
      updating weights so I think it is pretty much ready to run with a smidge of debugging.</p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p>I ran into issues understanding back propagation, so in order to figure that out want to cut the size of my data down (probably good to do for testing everything out anyways) and then put in print statements that show the 
      size of all of the matrices that are generated. For back propagation you essentially have to undo all the matrix calculations you perform in forward propagation so theres a lot of transposes and mat mults so I think tracking 
      the size of everything throughout the process will help clear up what math is happening in back prop and why its reversing everything. In order to do that I'll have to cut my dataset down so running through everything doesn't 
      take forever and then finish implementing the actual iterative training process. I think that is doable next week so hopefully I can have the NN up and running. Then it will be a matter of putting it into a class and functions 
      so its more usable and then on to the other tasks I put in the writeup.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>I ran into the first really conceptually hard part of NN's this week that I didn't really understand (mathy stuff) so mostly the only impediments are working through those things. I think once I understand that though I'll have
      a pretty good grasp on what's going on so hopefully things move faster after that.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>I think overall it went pretty well this week. I ran into an issue with math stuff but I was starting to get a grasp on it. I think I spent too much time taking notes and reading through stuff to figure it out though and I think 
      it would have been better to just throw in print statements and actually see what the math is doing. Generally I've found that you come to understand things better when you apply it to something your working on and I didn't really 
      live up to that this week and as a result am still a bit confused on the back prop stuff.</p>
