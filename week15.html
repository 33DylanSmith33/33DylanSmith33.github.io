    <h1>Week 15 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>This week I tried to finish my implementation of my NN class so I could
    actually get my OOP version training but I got stuck in the backward 
    propagation. I got through 3 of my 4 layers but something is going wrong in 
    the last one that I couldn't figure out yet.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p> Next week I want to see if I can finish the backprop implementation and 
        then see if I can get updating weights finished but if not I will also 
        focus on writing the final report.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>Impediments are backpropagation is still getting me but I think the mistake 
        or hard part i'm running into is more a fact of my implementation than of 
        not understanding.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>I don't think theres too much I can do this far in to make the process go better.
