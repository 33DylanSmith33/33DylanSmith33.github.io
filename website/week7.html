    <h1>Week 7 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>This week I got my NN working and training to where it reached a .8 accuracy on the training data after 500 updates. I also had to spend a lot of time using print statements 
      to try and map adn understand the matrix math that was happening, especially in the back propagation.</p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p>Next week I want to make all of the code I have into a class so that I can eventually start making this much more functional. I got to where I am currently at making everything 
      by functions, but I want to put all of that into a class. The goal is to make this much more usable so that you can use varying architectures and choose different values for the hyperparameters.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>The only impediment I ran into this week was I still had trouble wrapping my head around the math of back propagation. I threw in a bunch of print statements and used input data that was just
      3x7 so I could visualize it better but I think I still have a little bit of work to do on that.</p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>I think something that worked really well was trying to make my code work on a smaller data input (3x7 vs 784x42000). This made it easier to visualize what was happening with the math and it also
      showed some bugs that came up when using different sizes of data which will be a bit of a head start when I start trying to make this usable in more ways.</p>
