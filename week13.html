    <h1>Week 13 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>Last week I worked on the network class to bring all my other classes together. I got it working 
        to some degree but only for this one use case I've been working on so I need to change it a little 
        to be more useable. I think that is just some minor tweaks but I haven't started on that yet so I 
        don't know if it will be more than I think.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p>For this next week I want to tweak my package like I mentioned above so that it is more useable. I 
        think that will mostly entail working on the network section and putting the other pieces together
         but not sure yet.Â 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>An impediment for next week is I will be at a wedding so finding the time to work on this project 
        will be a bit harder than normal. I plan to work on it this weekend though so that I can get the 
        work I need to do in before I go to the wedding.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>To improve the process I think more notes would help because when I start up after a few days off I'm
         not exactly sure where i left off so just making a "this is where I left off, what I did and what 
         I was doing" after each work session would probably save a fair amount of time.
