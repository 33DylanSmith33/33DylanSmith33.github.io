    <h1>Week 2: missed post</h1>
    <p>I missed post about completing this by Friday so this is late but figured I'd give an update anyways.</p>
    <p>Last week I took notes on the video that started the project I want to do for this which is building a neural net from scratch. I also looked into some of the things that Professor Knox talked about in some Piazza posts. I think from this research I have a pretty good idea of what will go into this project. The implementation from the video was done in like 30 minutes. I expect it to take me longer than that but still under the 45 hours we'll have for the project. In order to expand the project beyond this, I also want to create a visualization of the neural net so I can visualize how the nodes are changing (maybe with colors) during training and through different methods. I also want to implement different hyper parameters to measure how they affect the learning rate and performance of the NN. Finally if I have enough time, I want to see if my implementation of the NN can function with different data inputs and use cases. Likely all simple use cases but through this I want to learn how a NN has to be setup to work with different kinds of input data.</p>
    <p>I think with all of that I should gain a much deeper understanding of how this technology works and be better setup to build one of these in the future for other cases as well as understanding when and where to use it most effectively.</p>
