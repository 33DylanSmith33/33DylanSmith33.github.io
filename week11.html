    <h1>Week 11 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>Last week, and over the break I worked on implementing my neural network in an OOP manner. I got the layer class working and 
        have started implementing the overall NN class which will handle the forward and backward propagation (training) as well as 
        the testing once the network has been trained. I also found a really good youtube channel by Andrej Karpathy that explains
        NN's in a really intuitive fashion so if anyone is interested in NN's and ML I'd recommend checking that out.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p> Next week I want to finish the NN class so that the network can train and make predictions. I have the backward propagation left
        and they way I have things set up and passed I might have to refigure out how to implement the gradient so that part might take a
        bit but once that's done, it should just be debugging and optimizing everything. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>The only impediment I see is that I will have to implement back propagation in a different way than I did before so that might take 
        some doing to figure out.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>I really got into the bones of creating a OOP version of my NN and it has been a really good learning method to understand how to 
        actually build an NN and what goes into each part. This is part of the process so it's more something to learn than to make better,
        but I don't know if the class structure I have is the best way to do this but that's something that I'm learning and changing as I go.
