    <h1>Week 10 Update - Smith</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you do last week?</strong></p>
    <p>Last week, I worked on modularizing my NN. All of the different classes have been taking longer than I thought so 
        this week I was working on getting the data in the right format for training and testing. The input is a csv file 
        for training and one for testing data. It then gets that into the correct form for training (observations as columns)
        and then getting the labels into a format that can be used for classification.  
    </p>
    <p><strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong></p>
    <p>Next week, I will be working on the layer class and the activation class. These are the infrastructure parts of the NN,
        so they have to be done before I can work on other parts. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong></p>
    <p>There aren't really any impediments beyond just getting this all figured out. Making all of the classes and connecting 
        everything together has been taking longer than I thought so it's just slow going.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Reflection on the process, how can you make the process work better?</strong></p>
    <p>I think something that might make the process better would be to plan it out more so that I can have an idea of where to starta
        and what sections to work on, but I also am not sure about that becuase I've already spent a lot of time this project trying to 
        plan or research and I think it is more helpful to just jump in and learn by doing.
